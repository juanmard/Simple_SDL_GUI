Welcome, this is SSG which stands for Simple SDL GUI. SSG is a set of
functions and structures helpful to create Graphical User Interfaces.
It uses the SDL2 and SDL2_image libraries.

The purpose of this project is to have my own set of utilities to make
my own programs/projects with a GUI. I'm making this project to learn
and practice programming in C as well.

SUMMARY:
1) Explanation of the structure of SSG
2) How to setup the elements of SSG
3) How to compile the main.c for testing


===============================================================
==================== 1) EXPLANATION OF SSG ====================
===============================================================

SSG is divided into :
a) the elements with which the user can interact
b) the structures where these elements are stored
c) the functions that make these elements interact with each other and
   with the user

~~~~~~~~~~~ a) the elements/objects ~~~~~~~~~~~

Note: Each time I'll say "object" I will be meaning the structures in
the C language that represent elements with which the user can interact.
I don't mean to refer to the "objects" of an Object Oriented programming
language.

The elements with which the user can interact are:

- ssg_button:
    These are buttons that call a function when being pressed so as to
    trigger a certain action

- ssg_text:
    These are rectangles showing a text with a given font and colour

- ssg_debug_text:
    These are similar to ssg_texts, but they show a variable's value
    and not a "static" string, they display a black rectangle
    behind the text and they are displayed at last so that they stay
    above of any other object in the screen

Note: To learn more deeply about these elements, check out their header
files to learn about the structures' fields and check out their C files
to learn about the functions associated with them

~~~~~~~~~~~ b) where are the objects stored? ~~~~~~~~~~~

Each one of these objects are stored in a linked list, and the pointers
pointing to these linked lists are stored in an ssg_menu, which is also
stored in a linked list. To make it simpler:


ssg_button ------------> ssg_button_list linked list
             stored in
ssg_text   ------------> ssg_text_list linked list
             stored in

ssg_button_list <------------------------\
                   has a pointer to       --- ssg_menu
ssg_text_list <--------------------------/


An ssg_button_list stores all the buttons that must be displayed
together, an ssg_text_list stores all the texts that must be displayed
together. An ssg_menu points to an ssg_button_list and an ssg_text_list,
so an ssg_menu "stores" all the buttons and texts that must be displayed
together.


ssg_menu1 --\
ssg_menu2 ---\
ssg_menu4 ----------- "stored in" --------> ssg_menu_list
...       ---/
ssg_menuN --/


All of the menus that can be displayed are stored in one single
ssg_menu_list linked list (for a better understanding, read the header
files).

The ssg_menu_list represents all the possible forms our GUI will take.
But this GUI should be displayed somewhere. That's why we're using SDL2.
Our GUI will have an SDL_Renderer so as an SDL_Window to be displayed. It will
also take a font, which is an SDL_Surface made from an image. To sum up,
a GUI needs a window, a renderer, a font (used when printing letters) and
a list of all the menus it uses. This is the structure ssg_gui declared inside
the file include/ssg_gui.h, and it will represent all we'll be needing to
have a working SSG GUI (yeah, the G in SSG already stands for "GUI", nevermind).

The ssg_debug_texts are not stored in any linked list for now.

~~~~~~~~~~~ c) the functions ~~~~~~~~~~~

The functions of each element or linked list can be found in each one
of the ssg_*****.c files.

When a button is pressed, the function check_button() is called, which
checks which is the menu that is currently enabled, and depending on
that, it calls the function that handles which button has been pressed
that is related to the current menu.
Let's say the current menu is the menu called "Welcome!", the function
that handles what action must be done depending on the button that has
been pressed is written in the welcome.c file. Otherwise, if it's the
"The Hall" menu that is enabled, the function that handles that is
written in the hall.c file.


===============================================================
====================== 2) SETTING SSG UP ======================
===============================================================

Once we've copied all of the ssg_*****.c and .h files, we need a main.c
file (you might want to just copy the main.c file in the git repo).
To initialize your GUI you use init_gui in src/ssg_gui.c, which only
takes as parameter the name the window should have.

Now we have to create all of the "objects"/elements with which the
user will be able to interact and all the linked lists that will store
them. We create an ssg_menu_list, we create all the ssg_menus we want
and we add them to the ssg_menu_list. For each ssg_menu we create, we
have to add a case to the check_button() function in the
ssg_menu_list.c, we have to create a C file to write the function
that handles which button from that menu has been pressed (in my
example, the welcome.c file has the check_pressed_buttons1() function
and the hall.c file has the check_pressed_buttons2() function). You
also have to add as many ssg_buttons and ssg_texts to the ssg_menus
you need

Then you need to enable the menu you want to be displayed at first
when executing the program. Finally, call the event_loop() function.

Don't forget to close the GUI (close_gui() in ssg_gui.c), which will free
everything except the ssg_debug_texts, which, for now, need to be freed by hand
using free_debug_text().


===============================================================
==================== 3) COMPILING THE CODE ====================
===============================================================

If you want to compile this code you'll need SDL2 and SDL2_image.

To compile it you have to execute

$ make
$ ./main

in the shell while in the "Simple_SDL_GUI" folder.
The main.c and the menus C files are only an example.
